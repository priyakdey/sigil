# Sigil

**Sigil** is a minimal-dependency, lightweight and modular cryptographic library
in Java, for working with JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) family of standards.
It supports secure signing, encryption, key handling and encoding/decoding of JWT, JWS, JWE components.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an educational and unfinished project.
> Use some industry standard and well known libs for production like auth0
